# Real-Time Portfolio Rebalancing with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a basic portfolio rebalancing strategy using machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning, and traditional rebalancing strategies for comparison. The purpose of this project is to explore dynamic asset allocation strategies that adapt to real-time market conditions, aiming to optimize returns while minimizing risk.

### Key Features:
- **Reinforcement Learning Model** for dynamic rebalancing
- **Quarterly Rebalancing** strategy as a benchmark
- **Portfolio Backtesting** to compare strategy performance
- **Performance Metrics**: Cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and volatility

## Installation

To run the code, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-rebalancing-ml.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd portfolio-rebalancing-ml
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Files

- `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the reinforcement learning model and performs portfolio backtesting.
- `A2M.csv`: The stock data file used for training and backtesting.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Performance Metrics

- **Cumulative Return**: The total return generated by the portfolio over time.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return.
- **Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value.
- **Volatility**: The standard deviation of returns over a 30-day rolling window.
